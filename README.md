# Limio-Application

Link to the project is found here:

## User Stories:
- Must set length of word to 5 letters e.g. word.length == 5
- Must restrict number of tries to 6 to guess the word - so set an integer counter variable
- Add colour of tiles so e.g. green if the letter is correct spot, yellow if letter in the word but wrong spot, and grey if the word not in the spot at all
- Can ensure keyboard button press corresponds to actual letter
- Must ensure word input is an actual word
- Correct word turns every letter to green and stops the game for the winner

## Key features:
- Instructions modal appears on game start, can close and reopen with instructions button
- Winner modal appears when on game win, alongside the definition of the word and how to pronounce it using the dictionary and text to speech API
